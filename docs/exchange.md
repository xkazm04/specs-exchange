## Introduction

A crypto exchange is a web application where users can trade their crypto assets. The exchange operator is the one who owns private keys to all of the user's crypto assets - in this case, we are talking about a custodial exchange leveraging a custodial wallet.

Every exchange must have wallets for every crypto asset it supports. Every exchange user must obtain an account for every asset they are trading. The exchange operator defines the trading pairs that can be traded by users and usually charges a fee for every trade performed.

â€ŒTrades are not performed on the blockchain (on-chain), as this would be extremely slow and expensive. All trades are in fact virtual transactions between user accounts.
